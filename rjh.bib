abstract = {Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) is a commonly used nondestructive method to perform in-line monitoring of film thicknesses and optical indexes for the semiconductor industry. SE metrology can also monitor film composition by correlating optical indexes to species concentration. Germanium concentration (Ge{\%}) measurement after SiGe epitaxial layer is a critical application at 40/28nm nodes to evaluate strain induced in the PMOS channel;. however, for 28nm and beyond, metrology needs to monitor Ge{\%} on more complex SiGe film processes. This paper describes accurate and stable Ge{\%} measurement on multi-SiGe layers by using optimized optical models and multiple correlation methodologies using SE metrology and how SiGe and Si-cap thicknesses can be reported simultaneously and independently. This paper demonstrates how to create enhanced SiGe m odels using KLA-Tencor Off-Line Spectral Analysis software based on DoE wafers with wide range split. Five different Ge{\%} conditions are considered and multiple correlations created to report Ge{\%} with less than 1{\%} absolute offset to XRD reference tool. The final measured result also shows excellent Ge{\%} stability (STDEV ∼ 0.13{\%}) even when multi-SiGe thicknesses are changed. {\textcopyright} The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract = {Current advanced lithography processes are based on a Critical Dimension (CD) budget of 10nm or less with errors caused by exposure tool, wafer substrate, wafer process, and reticle. As such, allowable CD variation across wafer becomes an important parameter to understand, control and minimize. Three sources of errors have an effect on CD Uniformity (CDU) budget, run-to-run (R2R), wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and intra-wafer. While R2R and W2W components are characterized and compensation control techniques were developed to minimize their contribution [1] the intra-wafer component is more or less ignored with the consequence that its sources of errors have not been characterized and no compensation technique is available. In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze intra-wafer CD sources of variations identifying the non-random CDU behavior and connect this with disturbances caused by processing errors described by their wafer spatial coordinates. We defined a process error as disturbance and its effect as a feature response. We study the impact of modeling spatial distribution of a feature response as calculated by diffractive optical CD metrology (scatterometry) and relate it to a programmed process disturbance. Process disturbances are classified in terms of time characteristics that define their spatial distribution. We demonstrated feature response to a disturbance behavior as statistical values as well as spatial profile. We identified that CD response is not sufficient to determine the sources of process disturbance and accordingly added responses from other features, which add to detection of CDU sources of error. The added responses came from scatterometry principle based on model definition of a litho pattern described by its shape with characteristic features: bottom CD, resist thickness, sidewall angle and bottom antireflective layer thickness. Our results show that process errors with continuous intra-wafer variation, such as PEB and BARC thickness have larger effects on CDU compared to process errors with discrete intra-wafer behavior, such as dose and defocus. Correlation between multiple feature responses to process disturbance was characterized as spatial covariance between CD to resist thickness and CD to SWA. Spatial feature covariance enhances capability to infer sources of process disturbance from metrology data.},

The normal-incidence methodology maintains much of the simplicity in mechanical design found in a standard reflectometer and the additional polarizing element has no effect on the footprint making the system amenable for integration, inline monitoring and advanced process control.

Additionally, we have demonstrated the ability of monitoring the mask CD quality with the presence of a protective pellicle. The determination of important critical dimensions in photomasks via optical techniques is appealing for several reasons: the method is non-destructive to photoresist and the sample is not subject to charging effects; the technique is capable of measuring the critical dimensions of grating structures down to approximately 40 nm; finally, minimal facilities are required for installation (no high vacuum, cooling or shielding of electromagnetic fields). Results will be presented showing the capabilities of OCD metrology for ADI, AEI and masks monitoring applications that emphasizes how the technology can be incorporated at many steps in the mask manufacturing process.},

abstract = {In modeling the optical properties of thin films, incorporation of roughness or interfacial layers is often required in the analysis of spectroscopic ellipsometric and spectroscopic reflectance data in order to achieve good agreement between the model and experimental data. The location of the roughness or interracial layer is usually discernable from the spectroscopic ellipsometric data; however, their location is not always unambiguous from spectroscopic reflectance data. In the current work, we have explored how the spectroscopic determination of the interfacial and surface roughness layers correlates with direct measurements of the surface using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Spectroscopic reflectance and subsequent analysis of several thick films demonstrate the difficulty in placement of a roughness or interfacial layer in the optical model. The samples involved in this study have films deposited on metal substrates and include stainless steel and aluminum. We have used AFM to directly measure the surface roughness in order to improve the optical characterization and model development. As an example, we have examined an 8,000 mn silicon dioxide film on stainless steel. Models with the placement of an interfacial layer between the substrate and film, or placement of a roughness layer at the surface produce fits with nearly equivalent mean squared error values; however, the surface roughness layer is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the interfacial layer. Analysis using AFM shows a surface topography consistent with the magnitude of the interracial roughness layer. In this example, the silicon dioxide layer was too thick for standard spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectroscopic reflectance was used exclusively in the analysis. For several samples with silicon dioxide on an aluminum substrate, an interfacial layer was necessary to produce a good model fit with the experimental data. These films of 500-1,000 mn thickness were analyzed using both spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectroscopic reflectance. The analysis for all films shows good agreement between the interfacial roughnesses calculated using an effective medium approximation (EMA) with AFM measurements, indicating the transfer or correlation of the substrate roughness to the surface. {\textcopyright} 2002 SPIE {\textperiodcentered} 0277-786X/02/{\$}15.00.},

The implanted hydrogen depth profiles are traditionally measured using nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) or secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) which have the disadvantages of requiring specialized equipment and, in the case of SIMS, being a destructive measurement. In the current work, a simplified method of measuring the depth profile of implanted hydrogen ions in silicon has been developed. Using a spectroscopic ellipsometer, optical data are collected from hydrogen implanted silicon wafers in a non-contact and non-destructive manner. The ellipsometric data from 600-980 nm wavelength are then analyzed by modeling the damage as a graded sub-surface layer in the silicon. By fitting this model to the experimental data, values for the depth of the implantation and the width of the implantation distribution can be extracted. This method offers the advantages of being repeatable, fast, and non-destructive, as well as using a piece of metrology equipment readily available in most semiconductor fabs. The method has been tested over a range of implant energies (24-92 keV) and hydrogen doses and shows excellent correlation to traditional NRA measurements for implant depth profile.},

Quantifying this mask error function (MEF) and the sources of the perturbation has been the topic of many papers of the past several years. Past studies have been content to evaluate these functions by statistical averaging thereby neglecting the potential influence of process and exposure contributions. The material presented here represents the findings of an extensive study of reticle-process interactions. Phase I of the evaluation consisted of focus and dose exposures of the reticle and subsequent modeling of the full-profile response. This analysis provided extensive information on the optimum-printed feature profiles while removing the contribution of across-field focus variations. The reticle was directly characterized using both conventional SEM and a new Nanometrics OCD Scatterometer technique. The full-field modeled response surface of the directly measured feature characteristics are then used to calculate the across-field MEF and provide an improved estimate of the true response of the feature to exposure. Phase II of the analysis turns its attention to characterization of the full-wafer process response. Both the modeled and directly measured reticle surfaces were removed from Scatterometry measured full-wafer exposures. Normal process variations consisting of photoresist and ARC thickness volatility are next used to show the response of the printed feature. Finally a summary of the relative contribution of each process perturbation to the feature profile error budget is discussed.},

abstract = {Optical orientation of reagents is one approach to achieving selectivity in a chemical reaction and has been used successfully to shift the point of equilibrium in bulk reaction mixtures of alkali-metal atoms and dimers. In addition to the continuous control of the point of equilibrium in the dimerization of sodium atoms, the control of the ortho-para nuclear spin distribution is shown here to also be a function of the degree of atomic spin orientation over a broad range. The direction of the spin conversion is para to ortho. For a mutlicomponent vapor, the optical orientation of 6 Li in a mixture of lithium-6 and lithium-7 is shown to produce a continuous and selective control of the isotopic dimer concentrations. 6 Li 2 (para) is selectively destroyed in the presence of the other dimer species. In this way the composition of a multicomponent metal vapor system at chemical equilibrium can be manipulated. The constraint produced by the optical orientation of one of the reagents offers a technique whereby the equilibrium yield of a multicomponent bulk chemical reaction can be laser controlled in a selective and continuous fashion.},

abstract = {Low-temperature rate coefficients for the reactions C 2 H + C 3 H 4 → products [C 3 H 4 = methylacetylene (propyne) CH 3 CCH and allene (propadiene) CH 2 CCH 2 ] are measured over the temperature range of 155-298 K. Absolute rate constants are determined using laser photolysis and transient infrared absorption spectroscopy. Both reactions are fast, approaching the kinetic limit and have either no temperature dependence or a slight negative temperature dependence. Over the experimental temperature range, the rate constants are fit to the following Arrhenius expressions: k CH3CCH = (1.6 ± 0.4) × 10 -10 exp[(71 ± 50)/T] cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 and k CH2CCH2 = (1.3 ± 0.6) × 10 -10 exp[(103 ± 136)/T] cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . The corresponding rate constants at 298 K are k CH3CCH = (1.9 ± 0.3) × 10 -10 cm 3 molecule -1 S -1 and k CH2CCH2 = (1.7 ± 0.3) × 10 -10 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . These measurements provide new reaction rate coefficients for the ethynyl radical, C 2 H, with C 3 H 4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. These are necessary to extend current photochemical models of Jupiter, Saturn, and its satellite Titan.},
