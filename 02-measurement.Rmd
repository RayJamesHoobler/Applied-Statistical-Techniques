### Check standard 



#### Background and data 

>The measurements on the check standard duplicate certification measurements that were being made, during the same time period, on individual wafers from crystal #51939. For the check standard there were:

- J = 6 repetitions at the center of the wafer on each day
- K = 25 days

[Check standard for resistivity measurement](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/mpc/section6/mpc62.htm)

#### Reading the dataset

```{r}
check_standard <- read_table2("NIST data/MPC62_clean.DAT", col_names = TRUE) %>%
  rowid_to_column()
check_standard
```

#### Level-1 standard deviation

Measurements for *J* runs over *K* days for *L* runs are:

$$
Y_{lkj}(l = 1, \, \ldots, \, L, \,\, k=1, \,\ldots, \, K, \,\, j=1, \,\ldots, \, J)
$$
The level-1 repeatability (short term precision) is calcuated from the pooled standard deviation over days and runs

$$
s_{1lk} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{J-1} \sum_{j=1}^{J}{(Y_{lkj} - \overline{Y}_{lk{\small \, \bullet}})^2}}
$$

with

$$
\overline{Y}_{lk{\small \, \bullet}} = \frac{1}{J}\sum_{j=1}^{J}{\overline{Y}_{lkj}}
$$
As stated in the e-Handbook:
>An individual short-term standard deviation will not be a reliable estimate of precision if the degrees of freedom is less than ten, but the individual estimates can be pooled over the K days to obtain a more reliable estimate. 

The pooled level-1 standard deviation estimate with v = K(J - 1) degrees of freedom is
$$
s_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} s_k^2}
$$

```{r}
s1_chkstd <- check_standard %>%
  mutate(Stdev_sq = Stdev^2) %$% 
  mean(Stdev_sq) %>% 
  sqrt()

s1_chkstd
```

Several comments on the code above. I've introduced the `%$%` operator. This allows me to use indivdual columns from my data frame and is useful for preforming mathematical operations on a specific column of data. It is from the **magrittr** package.

I find this type of code easy to read and understand. Describing the operations is simple, I'm just working from inside out of the equation:

- creating a new column of data that is $(Stdev)^2$
- finding the mean of that new column
- taking the square root of that number to give $s_1$.

#### Level-2 standard deviation (reproducibility)

$$
s_{chkstd} = {\large s}_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{K-1} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( \overline{Y}_{k \, \small{\bullet}} - \overline{Y}_{\small{\bullet}  \small{\bullet}} \right) ^2}
$$
with 

$$
\overline{Y}_{\small{\bullet} \small{\bullet}}  = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \overline{Y}_{k \, \small{\bullet}}
$$

Which is simply the standard deviation of the daily measuremnts

```{r}
s2_chkstd <- check_standard %$%
  sd(Resistance)

s2_chkstd
```

#### Control chart for standard deviation - Precision

```{r}
UCL_precision_ckkstd <- s1_chkstd*sqrt(qf(0.95, 5, 125))
UCL_precision_ckkstd
```

```{r}
ggplot(check_standard) +
  geom_point(aes(rowid, Stdev)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = UCL_precision_ckkstd), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title =  "Precision control chart", subtitle = "Probe_ID 2362", x = "measurement", y = "ohm.cm", caption = "UCL calcuated at 95% level of confidence") +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.096, label = "UCL", colour = "red")
```

#### Control chart for measurement bias and variability

The control limits for monitoring the bias and long-term variability of resistivity with a Shewhart control chart are given by

$$
UCL=\text{Average} + 2 \cdot s_2 \\
Centerline=\text{Average} \\
LCL=\text{Average} âˆ’ 2 \cdot s_2 \\
$$

```{r}
ggplot(check_standard) +
  geom_point(aes(rowid, Resistance)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (mean(Resistance) + 2*s2_chkstd)), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (mean(Resistance) - 2*s2_chkstd)), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title =  "Shewhart control chart", subtitle = "Probe_ID 2362", x = "measurement", y = "ohm.cm", caption = "Control limits calcuated with k = 2") +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 97.12, label = "UCL", colour = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 97.02, label = "LCL", colour = "red")
```


### Gauge study

#### Background and data
>Measurements on the check standards are used to estimate repeatability, day effect, and run effect	The effect of operator was not considered to be significant for this study; therefore, 'day' replaces 'operator' as a factor in the nested design. Averages and standard deviations from J = 6 measurements at the center of each wafer are shown in the table.

- J = 6 measurements at the center of the wafer per day
- K = 6 days (one operator) per repetition
- L = 2 runs (complete)
- Q = 5 wafers (check standards 138, 139, 140, 141, 142)
- R = 5 probes (1, 281, 283, 2062, 2362)
