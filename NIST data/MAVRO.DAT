This is Dataplot data file     MAVRO.DAT
NIST filter transmittance experiment
NIST experimentalist--Mavrodineaunu
Date--1970's
Response variable = transmittance of a filter
                    (nominal value = 2)
Number of observations = 50
Number of variables per line image = 1
Order of variables on a line image--
Response variable = transmittance
Note--data collected by automatic data acquisition system
      at 10 observations per second; thus these
      50 observations were collected in 5 seconds.
      The sampling rate is controllable by Mavro.
Question--what value to assign to the filter?
          with what uncertainty?
Statistical areas--univariate analysis
                   time series analysis
                   4-PLOT
