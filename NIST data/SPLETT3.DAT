Boulder Eddy Current Probe Sensitivity Study
Goal: Determine the effect of probe coil construction
      factors on eddy current.
2**3 full factorial experiment (part of a larger experiment)
Number of observations                   = 8
Total number of variables per line image = 4
Order of variables on a line image--
   Response variable = probe impedance deltaz (ohms)
   Factor 1 = number of wire turns  (2 levels: 90, 180)
   Factor 2 = wire winding distance (2 levels: 0.38, 1.14) (inches)
   Factor 3 = wire guage       (2 levels: 40, 48) (awg)
